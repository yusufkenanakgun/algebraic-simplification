# algebraic-simplification
This project simulates compiler optimization techniques using three different Yacc (Bison) files: Constant Folding, Copy Propagation, and Algebraic Simplification. These techniques are applied to simplify expressions and improve the efficiency of the code by reducing unnecessary computations, propagating variable values, and simplifying algebraic expressions during compilation.
